  <!Main Content/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Making the decision to further my education and make a career change has not been an easy one. My background is in the salon industry, an industry I am passionate about and thrived in. That is until repetative use injuries caused me to reflect on how important continuing on that path was un comparison to having any sort of quality of life moving forward as pain was becoming an underlying element of each moment of my life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That being said, before anything else, I am a mom. I have 5 beautiful children who I love more than I could have possibly imagined before they came into my life. Everything in my life I do for them. For them to have a mother they can be proud of. For them to see as long as they are willing to put in the work, anything is possible. For them to grow into people they can be proud of.</p>        
    <br>
    <p>When my injuries tansformed into disabilities, I had to make some decisions. I had three viable options at this point from my perspective. Continue workinig as a salon owner and hair stylist which I loved and had allowed me to be a more present mom until this point but now meant living in pain and not being able to be there mentally, emotionally and spiritually for my children at the level they deserve. Apply for disability, which I have been assured I would definately be approved for but would require leaving the work-force all together. Something I am in no way ready for. Or...choosing a new career path.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As you you already know, I chose the third option. I had to find a way to provide for my children but I didn't want to just find a job that would pay the bills. I have been blessed with having a career that I loved and excelled in for the better part of two decades. A career where I had the privilidge of being a part of making others feel more confident and happier. A career in which, me sharing my skills and talent with my clients, provided me the privilidge of seeing my clients walk out of my salon with with a lifted spirit and a brighter smile.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now I had a new challenge. How do can I find a new career path that I will find equally as fulfilling in my soul. How does one go from their dream job to choosing a perspective career path again? It has taken me 6 years (and a lot of new challenges and barriers) to figure this out. About a year ago, after working as a technical support associate for Amazon's digital and devices department, I had an epiphany while looking at the career choice options Amazon provides to their employees. I can do whatever I want to!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Yes. You read that correctly. I. Can. Do. Whatever. I. Want. To. This had never occured to me before. Ever. I am a fairly intelligent person, I love learning, I have a ton of varied skills, people are my first passion and I am, most importantly, drivin. For some reason, in that moment, I felt like a weight like I had not felt before had been lifted from my shoulders. I didn't have to find the path that would make others happy. Or the path that would best align with my previous career. Or even the feild that I would do best in. I only had to decide what I want now, what would make me happy going forward.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This may sound condradictory to what I mentioned above however, in finding what makes me happy, I am also learning how I can be the best mom, woman and person I can be as well. More than anything in the world, I want my children to grow to be happy, healthy (physically and emotionally) people who live a full life. What better way to help them to do that than to do my best to be a happy, healthy person living a full life as an example?</p>
    <br>
    <p>So, by the grace of God and having access to Amazon's career choice program and a lot of hard work, here I am. Over half-way through Correlation One's software development program. I decided internet technology is the world I want to be a part. The incredible evolution taking place with AI and IT as whole is beyond imagination. The directions one can take in the feild are vast and I will still have the ability to be creative in my work and be a part of making others' days better with what I do. I am so excited to have begun my journey into this foreign world and can't wait to see where it leads.</p>
