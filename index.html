        <p>Coming from life as a working mom in the the ever ever-evolving, creative and highly competitive beauty industry, I am now beginning a new season of my life. Gone are the days of indecisiveness and second guessing my ability to succeed in this almost foreign world of tech I have chosen to immerse myself in.</p>

        <p>My decision to attend this intense program 4 month Correlation One program for software development was not an easy one as I knew balancing a full time job, home life as a mother and the program would be hard to say the least. I knew it would take not only my own commitment but the support of both my professional leadership and colleagues as well as my family at home. However, this program is only available to me as part of my benefits as an Amazon employee and it is available at no harge to myself. After speaking with my support system, I was able to make the decision to take the plunge as this field is brimming with opportunity and right now is always the best time to begin something. This may even be my last opportunity.</p>

        <p>To this point, this program has proven to be engaging and challenging! I am learning to code various ways, so far HTML and CSS which I expected coming in to it. But I am also finding myself learning to let things go here and there in order to give more focus and energy to my education and growth.</p>

        <p>I am learning that sometimes it is ok to not be caught up on laundry, a few dishes in the sink a ren't actually going to hurt anything in the scheme of things and my home being clean at all times are not as important as I previously believed. This program is also teaching me how to break in to the field from a professional development perspective. My career success coach and the professional development sessions this program offers are helping me maintain confidence in myself and my abilities.</p>

        <p>With a sense of perseverance felt only a few times before, I find myself fighting to stay afloat in a fast-paced program busting at the seems with the information and opportunities to learn and practice the skills I need to become a developer.</p>
